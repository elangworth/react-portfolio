                    I am at the stage in my life where I am re-entering the work force. I took 6 years off to raise my two young boys.
                    I want to learn how to do something new. I chose to participate in this bootcamp so I can gain the skills needed to
                    work in this constantly changing industry. I chose this industry because I live in the Bay Area, my husband is a 
                    software engineer and I enjoy working on puzzles. In my free time I enjoy playing League of Legends with my friends.
                    A fun fact about me is that I play goalie in ice hockey and I have played in tournaments as far away as Thailand.
